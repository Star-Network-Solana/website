Contributing to STAR Network

Thank you for your interest in STAR Network.

STAR Network is an independent professional association initiative focused on building trust, verification frameworks, and emerging standards for Solana (Rust) education.
At this stage, our work is foundational and governance-sensitive, and contributions are handled deliberately.

Please read the guidelines below before engaging.

---

Current Contribution Status

STAR Network is currently operating in a read-only / guided feedback phase.

This means:
- The project is not open for general pull requests
- Contributions are not accepted by default
- All materials are evolving under active stewardship

This approach ensures consistency, neutrality, and long-term trust as frameworks mature.

---

What Kind of Input Is Welcome (Phase 1)

We welcome thoughtful, structured feedback in the following areas:
- Clarification questions about published materials
- Feedback on verification frameworks or registry models
- Pedagogical insights relevant to Solana (Rust) education
- Identification of ambiguity, gaps, or edge cases in documentation

All such input should be shared via GitHub Issues, not pull requests.

---

What Is Not Open for Contribution (Yet)

At this stage, please do not submit:
- Pull requests introducing new frameworks or standards
- Feature requests for automation, tooling, or platforms
- Certification criteria or scoring systems
- Marketplace, onboarding, or commercial proposals
- Requests for inclusion, endorsement, or partnership via issues

These areas require governance maturity and will be opened deliberately when appropriate.

---

How to Share Feedback
1. Open a GitHub Issue
2. Clearly reference the document or section you are responding to
3. Describe your feedback concisely and factually
4. Avoid promotional language or assumptions of authority

Issues that do not follow this structure may be closed without response.

---

Governance & Neutrality

STAR Network operates as a neutral coordination and verification initiative.

To preserve trust:
- Decisions are not made by popularity or volume of input
- All feedback is evaluated against documented criteria
- Silence or non-response does not imply rejection or acceptance

Governance processes will be published as the project matures.

---

Future Contribution Pathways

Formal contribution pathways — including working groups, review panels, and structured participation — will be introduced only after:
- Registry frameworks are stable
- Train-the-Trainer programs reach operational maturity
- Benchmarking and review cycles are clearly defined

When this happens, contribution guidelines will be updated transparently.

Guiding Principle

Standards require restraint before participation.
Trust requires process before openness.

Thank you for respecting the intent and maturity of this project.
