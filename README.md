# STAR Network

STAR Network is an independent professional association initiative focused on building trust, transparency, and shared quality frameworks for Solana and Rust education.

We are developing a selective, human-verified registry of educators to make real teaching and technical experience visible to enterprises, institutions, and developer communities.

STAR Network operates as a neutral coordination and verification layer — not a bootcamp or content platform — with a long-term goal of establishing sustainable standards and accreditation frameworks for decentralized technology education.
